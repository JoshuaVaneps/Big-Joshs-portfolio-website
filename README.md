# Portfolio-website

## Description
I have created adetailed portfolio website for potential employers to see my work, so that they may assess
whether I am the right fit for their organization.


## Usage
 This site concisely portrays my previous work, so when you load my portfolio
 you will be presented with my name,photo, and a navigation bar that easily labels and takes you to all of the sections of my webdite.
 All navigation links are functional and will scroll to the corresponding section. My first application is well lit and 
 slightly larger than my other projects and when a user clicks onto the site it will take them to the site in a new tab.  The page is fully 
 repsonsive and shows clearly at all screen sizes and it is even equipped with contact buttons that allow the user
 to reach me at my "linked in", "github", "email", or through a contact form page that is opened when the user clicks the "Contact me" button.
